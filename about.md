The Andreas C. Dracopoulos iDeas Lab was made possible through the generous support,
leadership, and vision of CSIS Trustee [Andreas C. Dracopoulos](http://csis.org/expert/andreas-c-dracopoulos). The iDeas Lab uses
the latest graphic design, audiovisual techniques, and technologies to
produce cutting-edge multimedia products that foster innovation and creativity,
and help bring CSIS scholarship to a wider audience.
